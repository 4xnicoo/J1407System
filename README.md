J1407 System is a Kerbal Space Program planet pack that adds a new star system inspired by early theories of the real-life J1407 star. Keep in mind this mod is not a scientific recreation, rather it is gameplay focused with lots of changes made to maintain a fun experience.
<br><br>
The system features a young star, a massive ringed gas giant, multiple moons, and several planets to explore and colonize. The J1407 system and Kerbol system are connected via wormholes.
